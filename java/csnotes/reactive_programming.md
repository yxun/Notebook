The main difference between messages and events is that messages are directed while events happen. Messages have a clear destination while events may be observed by zero or more (0-N) observers.

### Event-driven concurrency

The big difference between event-driven and imperative style is that the caller does not block and hold onto a thread while waiting for a response.

### Actor-based concurrency
